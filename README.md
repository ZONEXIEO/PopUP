This program creates a GUI application that continuously displays images on the screen at random positions. 
It fetches an approval status from a URL and displays images only when the status is '1'. 
The images are displayed in separate windows using multiprocessing, and the console window is hidden during execution. 
**Please note that this program was created for educational purposes only. Additionally, I want to emphasize that I bear no responsibility for any illegal use of this program.**.
