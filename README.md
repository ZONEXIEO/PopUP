This program creates a GUI application that continuously displays images on the screen at random positions. 
It fetches an approval status from a URL and displays images only when the status is '1'. 
The images are displayed in separate windows using multiprocessing, and the console window is hidden during execution. 
**Please note that this program was created for educational purposes only. Additionally, I want to emphasize that I bear no responsibility for any illegal use of this program.**.

To use the script, you need to download the files and install all the required libraries in the terminal using this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. After that, you need to download the images you would like to display and place them in the same folder. Then, you have to list all the names of the images in a list object called `image_paths` in the python script. Note that it doesn't matter how many images you list, but you must to list at least one.
To get the best experience from the program, you can customize settings according to your preferences and requirements, such as the x and y positions, screen size, etc.
